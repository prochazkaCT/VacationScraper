# Vacation Scraper
A web app using Mongoose and Cheerio that lets users scrape https://www.vacation.com/adventures-events for article summaries, link to articles and leave comments. You can play around with scraping the site at https://sleepy-everglades-46814.herokuapp.com

If you would like to use the app or inspect, feel free to clone to your local desktop and use npm init to install the package dependencies. Note that you will need to connect to mongo to run this application successfully. 

**Here is the simply styled index html landing page (note, I was trying to be on vacation when I wrote this application!):**

**An example of a jumbotron that will appear with an article summary, link to the article and an area for notes (the notes are not as permanent as I wish they could be at the moment).**

**Evidence that the database is working -- see below how the Heroku mLab MongoDB add-on is being populated with the articles scraped.**

ENJOY and go on an adventure!
